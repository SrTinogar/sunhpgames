	MEGANOID GOLD is a new fast arcade freeware game for your Hp48g(X).


Presentation
============

All this game is written in assembly machine language. That's why this game
is fast, and beautiful. I use greyscales grafics, the buzzer, buffer memory.
In this version, there are 3th best Meganoid player name's with their score,
at end of the game. Try to put your name in this top score, if you could :-)
MEGANOID is a Breakout game, you have to destroy a wall with a ball. Each
time you break a brick you win points and maybe some bonus.


Before playing Meganoid
=======================

Download MEGANOID.LIB in your HP48 in binary, using Kermit protocol.
Meganoid is a library object. To use it, you must store it in a port:


- Put the library in level 1 of the stack.

- type 0, 1, or 2 [..32], then STO according to whether you have a plug-in
  card.


Then press [ON]-[C].  (Press and hold [ON], then press [C] and release
them both).  The calculator will perform a warm start.
Meganoid Gold is now installed and ready for use.


Using it for the first time
===========================

Go to the library menu.
Press the white soft-key underneath the name MEGA.  If MEGA does not
appear in the menu, press [NXT] until it appears.
