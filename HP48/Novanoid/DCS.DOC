---------------------------------------------
The Programs:

EDIT:   Place a real number on the stack and EDIT will edit that level.

DIAMONDS: Play Diamonds.  This is so you can quickly play your new levels.

XPND:   Place a real number on the stack, and XPND will append that number
        of NULL levels to the end of the 'LEVELS.D12' library object.

ORDER:  Place a list of real numbers on the stack, and this command will
        order your levels.  It works just like the user-RPL ORDER command.

CONCAT: Place two level objects on the stack (Library Data) and CONCAT will
        Concatenate the two objects.  The result is one single level object.

ABOUT:  As the name says.

DIALEVELS: Recall the DIAMONDS' levels on the stack (Library Data).

---------------------------------------------

If no 'LEVELS.D12' is present in the current directory path, then one is
created in the current directory, with 1 NULL level in it.  So, if there
is no 'LEVELS.D12' present, and you execute n XPND, 'LEVELS.D12' is created,
and contains n+1 NULL levels.

Keys to use with EDIT :

cursor keys:  move the cursor
[<=]       :  Quit and save changes.
[*]        :  Toggle between bricks/ball mode.
[ON]       :  Abort Edit (changes are lost, after confirmation).
[OFF]      :  Turn the calculator off.

In ball mode:

[+/-]      :  Toggle fast/slow ball movements.
[EEX]      :  Change the ball direction (start moving up or down).

In bricks mode :

[ENTER]    :  Place a brick.
[DEL]      :  Delete a brick.
[+] or [-] :  Change the current brick.
[NXT]      :  Edit the next level.
[PREV]     :  Edit the previous level.
[D]        :  Delete the current level (after confirmation).
[I]        :  Insert a null level.

---------------------------------------------

Each level must contain at least one regular brick and 
one Diamond brick (brick #2).
You may not have more than 99 levels in one levels object.

This library has been written using only supported entries,
so it may work fine on any HP48.
However I cannot be taken responsible for any dammage caused
by the use or misuse of this library.
