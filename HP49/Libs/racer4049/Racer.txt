	This game is a Racing Freeware game.
It looks like Micro-Machines, There are multi-tracks
with best record for each one. If you put your name
somewhere for a new time record, your name will be 
writted in RACER game until somebody else beat your
time record. So play RACER, and distribute it so we
could see who is the best RACER player !!

	You may be the RACER Championship winner !!

RACER is a program for the HP48GX. It doesn't work in 
port, only in HOME variable.

		HOW to play RACER GAME:

	First, when RACER appears, hit [B] to START
a new game; hit [F] to quit RACER.
When you start a new game, you can select one of 32 RACER
tracks using [A] and [B] keys to choose. For each track,
you could see best lap time, and the winner name. It
looks like: 
		Track #02
		Best Lap: 00:06: 25
		Name: HORN

	When you track selection is done, hit [ENTER] and
prepare to RACER Championship.. The Race begin !!
You controle you RACER CAR with: [7] LEFT [8] RIGHT keys,
and you Speed UP using [6] key.

When you are racering, and when you want to return to RACER
track selection's, hit [DROP] key to stop RACER Race.
If your Lap Time is the best one, you may enter your pilot
Name (only 4 letters) using arrows keys to choose a letter,
and [ENTER] to write a letter.

	This game is still under improvements, so I hope
there aren't any problem using RACER 1.1 I hope the next
RACER 2.0 version will run on HP48G.

			Enjoy it !
